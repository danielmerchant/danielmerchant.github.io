                <h4>DataLab</h4>
                <p>The <a href="https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu">DataLab</a> is the nexus for research on Data Science and Analytics at the UW iSchool. We study large-scale, heterogeneous human data in an effort to understand why individuals, consumers, and societies behave the way they do. Our goal is to use data for the social good, in an ethical manner that can inform policy and impact lives for the better. As the focal point for industry partnerships related to “big data” and business analytics, the DataLab also provides infrastructure and support for student training and engagement in projects that involve the analysis of large datasets.</p>
                <h4>Capstone Group</h4>
                <p>This project was conducted as an extension of the <a href="https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu/projects/viziometrics">Viziometrics</a> project from 2017. Viziometrics uses computer vision on human data to create tools for social good.</p>
                <h5>Project Description</h5>
                <p>Millions of art images have been digitized over the last several decades. This has created new opportunities for art scholars and historians. However, searching and navigating these art images is difficult because of the sparsity of the metadata and contextual information used to describe these images. Unless one knows the exact title and artist, finding related artwork is a difficult task without the metadata. The research in this project addresses this challenge by developing unsupervised computer vision methods that will extract metadata automatically from images.  Our dataset will include more than 2 million art images from ARTstor, a non-profit organization that distributes art images to libraries and universities. If successful, we plan to build an interactive interface for exploring the extracted features and for developing a recommender system that could be used on platforms such as ARTstor.</p>

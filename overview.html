            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>In 2017, the Viziometrics project at the UW DataLab sought to analyze figures in scientific literature. They used computer vision techniques to find figures, charts, tables, equations, and diagrams with over 90% accuracy. One of the novel aspects of this research was its dataset. They collected over 1 million publications from PubMed, a scientific journal, for analysis. This dataset had never been explored by computer vision researchers. This is important because the figures that are contained within a research paper are crucial for understanding its impact - by using a computer to extract the important information from a paper, readers are able to recognize important parts of a research paper without reading the entire work.</p>

            <h1>Our Work</h1>
            <p>After the success of the first Viziometrics project, we were approached by ARTStor, a digital art library maintained by the Mellon Foundation. ARTStor’s collections span over 4 million art images. They wanted to improve the search functionality on their website to provide users with a more semantically-based search engine. For example, ARTStor’s current search engine requires domain-specific knowledge - to find an impressionist painting, a user cannot simply search “impressionist paintings” - they must know the titles of the paintings they are looking for, or other specific information such as the artist’s name. Even then, if a user wanted to find impressionist paintings and they searched “Claude Monet”, they would only find Claude Monet paintings - what if they wanted a collection of various artists? </p>
            <p>To solve this problem, we took two approaches. To solve the search-based problem we used ResNet50 classification to automate metadata enrichment on two different features of an art image - its “material” (painting, drawing, print, etc.) and its age. For the recommendation engine, we used feature extraction using ResNet50 and then used unsupervised clustering to find which images are most “similar” to each other. </p>

            <h3>Introduction: What is Our Project?</h3>
            <p>
                Millions of art images have been digitized over the last several decades. This has created new opportunities for art scholars and historians. However, searching and navigating these art images is difficult because of the sparsity of the metadata and contextual information used to describe these images. Unless one knows the exact title and artist, finding related artwork is a difficult task without the metadata. 

The Viziometrics group at the University of Washington Information School’s DataLab was contacted by ARTstor, an online art image database, to solve this problem. In order to improve ARTstor’s search capabilities, we wanted to create image classifiers that would be able to generate tags based on image content - such as “Portrait”, “Marble”, or “Impressionism”, for example. We decided that a deep learning approach would be appropriate for this task. In addition to the metadata tagging for search, we created a recommendation engine that allows users to view images similar to the one they are currently viewing. 

Search engines need metadata to effectively index data for query. By enriching the metadata for art images, users will be able to search for images more easily.

            <h3>Who Is Impacted By This Research?</h3>
            <p>
                Because this research will first be applied to the ARTstor dataset, ARTstor users will be the first to notice its effects. Ideally, automated metadata tagging could be expanded beyond the ARTstor image dataset, and could be utilized on other image datasets as well, expanding their search capabilities.

            <h3>What Benefits Does This Research Provide?</h3>
            <p>
                The improved search engine will help people find images they are looking for without knowing more contextual information. For example, a user looking for paintings with trees could simply search “Paintings with trees”, and the results would contain paintings with trees. At the moment, this is not the case. Metadata enrichment is the key to this improved search functionality, and would be invaluable for image search in general.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>In 2017, the Viziometrics project at the DataLab sought to analyze figures in scientific literature. They used computer vision techniques to find figures, charts, tables, equations, and diagrams with over 90% accuracy. One of the novel aspects of this research was its dataset. They collected over 1 million publications from PubMed, a scientific journal, for analysis. This dataset had never been explored by computer vision researchers. This is important because the figures that are contained within a research paper are crucial for understanding its impact - by using a computer to extract the important information from a paper, readers are able to recognize important parts of a research paper without reading the entire work.</p>
            <h5>Our Work</h5>
            <p>After the success of the first Viziometrics project, we were approached by <a href="https://www.artstor.org"> ARTStor</a>, a digital art library maintained by the Mellon Foundation. ARTStor’s collections span over 2 million art images. They wanted to improve the search functionality on their website to provide users with a more semantically-based search engine. For example, ARTStor’s current search engine requires domain-specific knowledge - to find an impressionist painting, a user cannot simply search “impressionist paintings” - they must know the titles of the paintings they are looking for, or other specific information such as the artist’s name. Even then, if a user wanted to find impressionist paintings and they searched “Claude Monet”, they would only find Claude Monet paintings - what if they wanted a collection of various artists? </p>
            <p>To solve this problem, we took two approaches. To solve the search-based problem we used ResNet50 classification to automate metadata enrichment on two different features of an art image - its “material” (painting, drawing, print, etc.) and its age. For the recommendation engine, we used feature extraction using ResNet50 and then used unsupervised clustering to find which images are most “similar” to each other. To explore the clustering on a subset of the ARTStor data, visit <a href="http://viziometrics.org/stats/cluster?corpus=artstor&feature=resnet&alg=tsne">this visualization.</a></p>
            <p>In order to train the models, we required a large dataset. We collected images and associated metadata from three sources: <a href="https://www.wikiart.org">WikiArt</a>, <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org"> The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, and <a href="https://www.artsy.net">Artsy</a>. We then combined these into one dataset. We then used this data to train classifiers for material and age. To read more, view the <a href="DSDAH.pdf">paper</a> we wrote.</p>
            <h5>Future Directions</h5>
            <p>In addition to models for material and age, we aim to automate metadata enrichment for other descriptive elements of artworks. <a href="https://artsy.net">Artsy</a> is a nonprofit art discovery platform that manages the <a href="https://artsy.net/categories">Art Genome Project</a>, which contains a set of more than 1,000 descriptive metadata tags for artworks. We aim to train models based on some of these metadata tags that could automate keyword enrichment, further improving the ARTStor search engine.</p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>ARTstor is one of the most popular digital art libraries for academic research. Unsurprisingly, it is commonly used by art historians and art history students. These users may be highly educated in arts (e.g. art professors), or they may be students with less art history experience. The improved search engine will benefit all users, but it will be most helpful for novice art historians and enthusiasts, because they have less domain knowledge. An experienced art history professor is likely to know specific names of artworks, and thus search may be easy for them. If they are searching for “impressionist paintings”, they would be able to search for Monet, Manet, Degas, or Cézanne from memory. However, a student with little art history experience is unlikely to know specific artists or artworks necessary for study - instead of simply searching “impressionist paintings” on ARTStor, they must first consult outside sources to even know what they are looking for. We aim to transform ARTStor from an art database to an art discovery platform. The recommendation engine is another excellent tool for this. If a novice user finds an image they like, and similar images are shown to them, they now have the information they need to explore further. </p>

I'm a full-stack software engineer living in New York, NY. I'm currently employed at [Amazon](https://amazon.com), where I work in [Selections and Catalog Systems](https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/ascs). I develop highly distributed software systems that power the world's largest product catalog, processing hundreds of millions of updates daily that power the online buying experience for Amazon customers worldwide. The teams that I work with build:
* Classifiers that group products based on shared attributes.
* Read/write platforms for catalog schema that ensure products contain accurate, relevant information.
* Interactive web-based tools that allow taxonomists and program managers to govern catalog schema.

I attended the University of Washington, where I graduated from the [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) with a B.S. in Informatics in 2018. At the iSchool, I worked as a research assistant in the [Viziometrics](http://viziometrics.org/) lab under Dr. Jevin West.

I'm interested in using computers to make the world a better place to live. If you are interested in that too, feel free to reach out to me.
